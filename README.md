# Digital-Control-Logic-With-PLC
This project involves designing a digital control logic with ladder logic programming.
 In this project, pressure is maintained in a receiver on a compressor application. I make use of two pressure switches (LOW and HIGH) as inputs and 
 Pump and Indicator Lights as outputs.
